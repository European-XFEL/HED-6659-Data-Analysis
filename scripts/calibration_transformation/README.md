# Calibration_Transforms
Creator; thomas stevens

This file allows the transform of heXRD calibration files into .poni files from pyFAI and vice versa.  
The use of these files should be fairly easy with the second cell in both the 'pyFAI_to_heXRD_calibration_transform.ipynb' and 'heXRD_to_pyFAI_calibration_transform.ipynb' allowing for input of the required information.
The scripts listed as '3D_plotting... .ipynb' are for plotting in 3D the detector positions for checking continuity and ensuring that your initial calibration is indeed where you expected.
